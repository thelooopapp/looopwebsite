# Changelog

Changes to thelooopapp.com, newest first. This file is not published (see `_config.yml`).

## 2026-10-13 08:34 CT

### New Features
- **New homepage** (`index.html`, `home.css`) built to match the App Store screenshots and `marketing/COPYWRITER_GUIDELINES.md` in the app repo.
  - Hero leads with the approved line "Peace of mind for you, independence for them", states "Looop is a safety notifications app" in green and the tagline in orange.
  - "Find your people" sits directly under the hero, with a dotted map illustration of 5 Loved Ones in 4 cities (San Diego, Austin, Chicago, Madrid) and cards linking to the three audience pages.
  - Six feature sections use transparent phone art, followed by a privacy band ("Your Data Never Sold" first), three guides from Resources and a closing call to action.
  - Adds a meta description, canonical URL, Open Graph and Twitter tags, and a share image (`images/og-home.jpg`). The page had none before.
  - The `mailto:` contact form is replaced by a "Get in touch" block that shows the support address. The `#contact` anchor is kept because 77 links across the site point to it.
- **Transparent phone art** (`images/home/phone1.webp` to `phone6.webp`) re-rendered from `marketing/app_store_screenshots/canvas_source/project/*.dc.html` in the app repo with the background and headline removed.

### Design
- **Every other page restyled to match the homepage, with no wording changes** (`styles.css`, `article.css`, font link and inline colours in 35 pages): Plus Jakarta Sans replaces Poppins; the app's brand blue (`#1B73C6`), green and orange replace the old navy, bright blue and lime; inner pages get a blue hero band and closing band; the footer uses the homepage's deep blue.
- **New product images on inner pages**, replacing the tilted-phone art that showed retired app screens:
  - `images/home/duo-lock-well.webp`: How it works hero, and the Newsroom "Product: notifications" download (`.png`).
  - `images/home/duo-aging.webp`: Aging parents hero. A new lock screen built from the screenshot source shows the alerts that page describes (Unusual Day, hospital arrival, phone untouched), next to Mom's Unusual Day.
  - `images/home/duo-peers.webp`: Friends and siblings. A "My People" group with Aunt Ira, Sam and Maya, so the page shows peers instead of parents and kids.
  - `images/home/wx-map.webp`: How it works "Weather where they are". A dotted US map with each person and the weather near them, replacing the old illustrated map.
  - `images/home/duo-home-alerts.webp`: How it works "See everyone at a glance", Who it's for, and the Newsroom "Product: home screen" download (`.png`).
  - `images/home/phone1.webp`: College families "Calm alerts".
  - `images/home/av-*.webp`: ringed portraits with a small activity badge replace the old blue-ringed avatars on Who it's for and Aging parents (green for a Typical Day, orange where the old avatar looked concerned).
  - Added section ids (`#families`, `#alerts`, `#people`, `#one-app`) so these sections can be linked directly.
  - Alt text on each replaced image now describes the new image.

### Not changed
- The old image files stay in `images/`; nothing links to most of them now, and they can be removed in a cleanup.

### Copy
- Aging parents, family cards: "For the stretched-thin middle" is now "For the stretched-thin" (page and its Markdown source).

### Typography and consistency
- **No single word alone on a last line.** The last two words of every heading, paragraph, list item and table cell are joined with a non-breaking space across all 36 pages, and `styles.css` / `home.css` add `text-wrap: balance` for short display lines and `text-wrap: pretty` for body text. A scan at 1280, 820 and 390 pixels wide found 2 remaining cases on desktop (both in the Life360 alternatives article, where the last word is too long to pair). The only wording change is on Who it's for: "One heads-up when someone needs a call." is now "A heads-up when they need a call."
- **One type scale for the whole site.** Inner pages now use the homepage's sizes: hero title up to 72px, green hero key line up to 40px, white hero lead up to 22px, section titles up to 46px, orange question lines up to 28px, 17px body text and 23px blue card titles. Hero product images are larger so the phones match the homepage's. Articles and legal pages keep a smaller long-form scale with the same font, weights and colours.
- **Same nav everywhere.** Inner pages get the "Download Looop" button, and the homepage nav now floats while scrolling like the inner pages' nav.

### Copy
- The quote "5 people I love in 4 different cities." now matches the homepage on Who it's for (was "Four people I love, four different places.") and on the Aging parents card (was "Four people, four places."), in the pages and their Markdown sources.

### Housekeeping
- Started this changelog and excluded it from the published site.
